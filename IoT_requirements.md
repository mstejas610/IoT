### **8. Individual LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green LEDs)**
- **Functionality**:  
  - Simulate traffic lights by visually representing the control system’s output.
  - Each LED corresponds to a traffic signal phase (stop, ready, go).

- **Necessity**:  
  - The core output mechanism for the traffic light system.
  - Provides a simple and intuitive way to observe and verify the system's functionality.

---

### **9. Breadboard and PCB**
- **Functionality**:  
  - **Breadboard**: Used for prototyping the circuit, allowing temporary connections without soldering.
